write an ansible role to enable https support for apache for an ubuntu node

Here is a sample Ansible role that enables HTTPS support for Apache on an Ubuntu node:

yaml

```yaml
- name: Enable HTTPS support for Apache on Ubuntu
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    apache_conf_file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
    ssl_cert_file: /etc/ssl/certs/ssl.crt
    ssl_key_file: /etc/ssl/private/ssl.key

  tasks:
  - name: Install mod_ssl module
    apt:
      name: libapache2-mod-ssl
      state: present

  - name: Create SSL certificate and key files
    copy:
      dest: "{{ ssl_cert_file }}"
      content: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <certificate content>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    copy:
      dest: "{{ ssl_key_file }}"
      content: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        <key content>
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    when: "'ssl.crt' not in lookup('file', ssl_cert_file) or 'ssl.key' not in lookup('file', ssl_key_file)"

  - name: Update Apache configuration to enable HTTPS
    lineinfile:
      dest: "{{ apache_conf_file }}"
      regexp: "^SSLCertificateFile.*$"
      line: "SSLCertificateFile {{ ssl_cert_file }}"
    lineinfile:
      dest: "{{ apache_conf_file }}"
      regexp: "^SSLCertificateKeyFile.*$"
      line: "SSLCertificateKeyFile {{ ssl_key_file }}"
    notify:
      - restart apache

  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```

This role assumes that the Apache web server is already installed and running on the target Ubuntu systems. The role installs the `mod_ssl` module, creates an SSL certificate and key file, and updates the Apache configuration to enable HTTPS support. The SSL certificate and key can be generated using tools like `openssl`. The Apache web server is restarted after making the necessary changes to the configuration file.

write an ansible role to check that a node can be reached and it is possible to become root

Here is a sample Ansible role that checks if a node can be reached and it is possible to become root:

yaml

```yaml
- name: Check node reachability and root access
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Check if the node is reachable
    ping:

  - name: Check if root access is possible
    become: yes
    command: whoami
    register: result

  - name: Display result
    debug:
      msg: "Root access is possible: {{ result.stdout == 'root\n' }}"
```

This role uses the `ping` module to check if the node is reachable, and the `become` directive with the `command` module to check if root access is possible. The output of the `command` is stored in the `result` variable, which is then displayed using the `debug` module to indicate whether root access is possible or not.

How to generate a free ssh certificate signed by a recognized authority

To generate a free SSH certificate signed by a recognized authority, you can use the Let's Encrypt CA (Certificate Authority). Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority that provides free SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS on websites.

Here's how you can generate a free SSH certificate with Let's Encrypt:

1.  Install the certbot tool on your server:

sql

```sql
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

2.  Generate a certificate:

css

```css
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
```

3.  Follow the prompt and provide your domain name to generate the certificate.
    
4.  The generated certificate will be stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain-name>/`. The private key is stored in `privkey.pem` and the certificate itself is stored in `cert.pem`.
    
5.  Configure your SSH server to use the certificate for authentication by specifying the path to the private key in your SSH configuration file.
    

Note: Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days, so you'll need to renew them regularly. You can set up a cron job to automate the renewal process.

How to generate a certbot certificate without be prompted

To generate a certbot certificate without being prompted, you can use the `certbot certonly` command with the `--standalone` and `--non-interactive` options. Here's an example:

css

```css
sudo certbot certonly --standalone --non-interactive \
    --email your-email-address \
    --agree-tos \
    -d example.com
```

Here's what each of the options does:

*   `--standalone`: tells certbot to use the standalone plugin, which runs its own temporary webserver to handle the validation process.
*   `--non-interactive`: tells certbot to run in non-interactive mode, which means it will not prompt you for input.
*   `--email`: specifies the email address to use for registration and recovery contact.
*   `--agree-tos`: automatically agrees to the Let's Encrypt terms of service.
*   `-d`: specifies the domain name(s) for which the certificate will be issued.

After running the above command, certbot will generate a certificate for the specified domain(s) and store it in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/`.

write a cron job to renew a certbot certificate

Here is an example of a cron job to renew a certbot certificate:

css

```css
0 0 * * * certbot renew --quiet --renew-hook "systemctl reload apache2"
```

This cron job will run the `certbot renew` command every day at midnight (0 0 \* \* \*). The `--quiet` option suppresses output from the renewal process, while the `--renew-hook` option specifies a command that will be run after the renewal is successful. In this case, the `systemctl reload apache2` command reloads the Apache service to pick up the new certificate.

Note: It's important to run the renewal process regularly to ensure that your certificates remain valid. The recommended frequency for renewing Let's Encrypt certificates is every 60 days.
