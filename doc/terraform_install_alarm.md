## Here's an example Terraform script that creates an alarm in AWS CloudWatch to shut down an EC2 instance if the CPU utilization stays below 2% for an hour:

> ```java
> resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "low_cpu_alarm" {
>   alarm_name          = "Low_CPU_Alarm"

>   evaluation_periods  = "6"
>   metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
>   namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
>   period              = "300"
>   statistic           = "Average"
>   threshold           = "2"
>   alarm_description   = "This metric monitor low CPU utilization for an hour and shuts down the instance if it remains below 2%."
>   dimensions = {
>     InstanceId = "${aws_instance.example.id}"
>   }

>   scaling_adjustment     = "0"
>   adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
>   cooldown               = "300"

> This script creates a CloudWatch metric alarm that monitors the average CPU utilization of an EC2 instance every 5 minutes. If the CPU utilization stays below 2% for 6 consecutive evaluations (1 hour), the alarm triggers an action to stop the instance. The action is implemented using an Auto Scaling policy that decreases the capacity of the Auto Scaling group by 1, effectively terminating the instance.
> 
> Note that this script assumes you have an EC2 instance and an Auto Scaling group already created. You should replace the `aws_instance.example.id` and `aws_autoscaling_group.example.name` placeholders with the actual IDs/names of your resources.

> ## Here's an example Terraform script that creates an AWS Auto Scaling Group:
> 
> ```java
> resource "aws_launch_configuration" "example" {
>   name_prefix = "example"
>   image_id    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
>   instance_type = "t2.micro"
> 
>   # Add any additional configuration here, such as user data or security groups.
> }
> 
> resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "example" {
>   name                 = "example"
>   vpc_zone_identifier  = ["subnet-0123456789abcdef0", "subnet-0123456789abcdef1"]
>   launch_configuration = "${aws_launch_configuration.example.id}"
>   min_size             = 2
>   max_size             = 10
>   desired_capacity     = 2
> 
>   # Add any additional configuration here, such as load balancers or scaling policies.
> }
> ```

> This script creates an Auto Scaling Group with a minimum of 2 instances, a maximum of 10 instances, and a desired capacity of 2 instances. The `vpc_zone_identifier` parameter specifies the subnets in which the instances should be launched. The `launch_configuration` parameter references an AWS Launch Configuration that specifies the AMI, instance type, and any other instance configuration details.
> 
> Note that this is a basic example and you may need to add additional configuration depending on your use case, such as load balancers or scaling policies. You should also replace the `subnet-0123456789abcdef0` and `subnet-0123456789abcdef1` placeholders with the actual IDs of the subnets in your VPC.
