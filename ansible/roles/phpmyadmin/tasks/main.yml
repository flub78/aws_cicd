# Either as a subdomain which implies
# - to declare the subdomain in the S3 route to be directed to the correct IP
# - to add the subdomain to the certbot certificate
# - to create a virtual host conf for apache with correct phpmyadmin directory and certificate
# - to enable this virtual host
# - to restart apache.
#
# or to create a symbolic link to phpmyadmin
#
# Then phpmyadmin can be accessed at https://my_domain/phpmyadmin
# (use root and the mysql root password to connect)
